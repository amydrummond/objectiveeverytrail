ObjectiveEveryTrail: Acknowledgments

The ObjectiveEveryTrail is based upon the ObjectiveFlickr project by Lukhnos D. Liu. All credit goes to him. Thanks a lot! [1]

The class OFPOSTRequest is inspired by Ferdinand Svehla's code snippet [2]
which uses CFReadStream instead of NSURLConnection to perform better 
HTTP POST requests.
